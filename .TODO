1) AIDA let's use gorm: https://gorm.io/. cause in the assignment teacher suggest this package
2) Let's don't use gorilla/mux. In server.go we are using default http.mux. But you used gorilla mux in handler/booking_handler.go
    when you try to get variables from request like "id"
    USE: r.URL.Query().Get("id") 
    instead 
    vars := mux.Vars(r)
	idStr := vars["id"]
    UPDATED: i replaced them
