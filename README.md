### **Booking Process** 📲
1. Users can create, update, or delete bookings.
2. The system automatically ensures room availability before confirming bookings.
3. Staff can review all bookings to manage the hotel's schedule.

### **Room Management** 🏨
Rooms can be added, updated, or removed from the system. Each room is linked to specific details like room type, price, and availability.
